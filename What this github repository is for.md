TVP-website
===========
This github repository is intented to serve all volunteer developers to communicate and coordinate activities related to The Venus Project website. We can create issues, assign people to them, communicate on their progress, and finally close them when they're solved.

If you need to ask a question, open a new issue, give it the lable "question" and post it. Then everybody else will be able to chime in.

For every activity in the github repository (be it opening/closing of issues or posting messages) all the members of the repository get notified via email. In this way all of us stay in the loop and get updated, and with our communication we reach everybody.
